# Data Science Notebook for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

This is a simple modification of Jupyter's [official datascience notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook), with the following basic modification(s): 

* `scikit-learn` is downgraded to version `0.17`

## A note on Python versions

Because this extends the general data science notebook, it is capable of executing both Python 2.7.x and 3.x. Generally, when you open an existing notebook, the correct version kernel (2.7.x) will be selected, but in some cases you may have to change the kernel version.
